# ConvNet in CPP

Reimplementation of my MLP in C++ as well as attempting to add convolutional layers

To get started

```
make
build/conv.exe
```

## To-do

- [] Add convolutional layers
- [] Support multiple different activation functions (from `Activation` class)
- [] Add quantization methods (for later use to be used in FPGAs)
- [] Add regularization techniques
    - [] Dropout
    - [] Early Stopping (save weights and stop training after no improvement)
